**Done**
- ROM extracted from user-provided zip → `roms/firered.gba`; MD5 verified = `e26ee0d44e809351c8ce2d73c7400cdd` (FireRed USA 1.0).
- Cloned 40Cakes/pokebot-gen3 @ `5dd898f` (gitignored; `setup.sh` re-clones at pinned commit).
- Python 3.12 venv + all pokebot deps installed. libmgba-py 0.2.0 bindings unzipped into `pokebot-gen3/mgba/`.
- No root available for `apt install libmgba0.10t64`, so the .deb is extracted into `vendor/lib/` and `dexbot/__init__.py` preloads it with `ctypes.CDLL(..., RTLD_GLOBAL)` — no `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` needed.
- `dexbot/` sibling package created (zero upstream diffs so far). `dexbot/m0_boot.py` boots headless, taps A through the intro, detects the title screen via `gMain.callback2 == CB2_TITLESCREENRUN` (memory, not pixels), waits out the fade-in, and dumps proof.

**Verified**
- `proof/m0_title.png` shows the full FireRed title screen; `proof/m0_memory.json` has the callback2 symbol + gMain bytes; `fixtures/m0_title.ss1` savestate saved.
- `tests/test_m0_boot.py` (headless: load fixture, assert `GameState.TITLE_SCREEN`) passes.

**Risky / notes**
- Upstream already ships far more than expected: `map_path.py` (pathfinding), battle handling, safari strategy, a savestate-based test harness (`tests/utility.py` with `AutomatedTestBotMode`, `@with_save_state`). M3/M5/M7 should reuse these heavily instead of building from scratch.
- `context.rom.game_name` is `"Pokémon FireRed (E)"` — the (E) suffix is their language tag for English, not Europe.
- The bundled libmgba-py build targets Ubuntu 23.04; works fine on 24.04 with the vendored 0.10.2 lib, but keep an eye on it.
